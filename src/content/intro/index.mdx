I enjoy backend development and building the logic that makes applications work.
I primarily use **TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL** and I focus on writing clean and reliable code.
I know it's important for systems to be **robust**, **secure**, and **scalable**.

I am an open-source contributor to **JSR** (the JavaScript Registry from **Deno**).

In my free time, I do technical management for a theater school. I also build electronics projects, which involves things like soldering and making my own batteries.

Currently, I am learning about **Web3** architecture.

Looking to join a great team.\
