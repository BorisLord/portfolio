I plan to develop my first desktop application : an ERC-20 wallet in Java\
Combining my interest in blockchain technology with a first use language project.\
The wallet will have a simple GUI and use Web3j to interact with the blockchain via JSON-RPC.\
Since I have no experience with Java, I am currently exploring how to handle GUI development in this language.\
I aim to start working on the project in the coming month.
