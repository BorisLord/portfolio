A website and blog for a company and school theater based in Paris.
Pocketbase was chosen as the backend for its simplicity and quick deployment.\
It includes a rich text editor, making it easy for non-technical users to write and manage blog articles without any hassle.\
Astro enables SSG, which improve performance and is SEO friendly.\
If in the future I need more interactivity, I can use the island concept in Astro and apply a framework only to specific pages or components.

Future updates will introduce new features, including:

- Online registration and payment for classes
- Automatic invoice generation
- Automated email notifications based on user actions or requests
- Dedicated student accounts to track progress, manage subscriptions, and access resources
  For a company of this size, Pocketbase offers an ideal combination of efficiency, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness.
