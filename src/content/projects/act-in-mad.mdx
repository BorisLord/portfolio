A website and blog for a company and school theater in Paris, built with Astro and Pocketbase.  
Pocketbase was chosen as the backend for its simplicity, robust design, and quick deployment. It also includes a rich text editor, making it easy for non-technical users to write and manage blog articles without any hassle.

Future updates will introduce several new features, including:

- Online registration and payment for courses and events.
- Automatic invoice generation for enrolled students.
- Automated email notifications based on user actions or requests.
- Dedicated student accounts to track progress, manage subscriptions, and access resources.

For a company of this size, Pocketbase offers an ideal combination of efficiency, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness.
