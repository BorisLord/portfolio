This application lets you trade cryptocurrencies across multiple brokers like Binance, Gate.io, Coinbase, and more using CCXT, a unified API.

The backend is connected to a microservice called Telegram-fetcher, which allows automated trading on supported brokers and API keys registered.

The frontend is simple, showing balances and open orders. Through the app, you can also place orders and add your API keys to link OrderOrbit with multiple brokers.
