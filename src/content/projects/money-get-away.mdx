This project serves as my introduction to the NestJS framework.
It is a backend service that enables customers to place orders and allows superusers to add, modify, or delete items.

- Secure authentication for both regular users and superusers is implemented, featuring a distinct role-based access control system.
- Users can browse available products, add desired items to their shopping cart, and finalize purchases.
- Superusers have exclusive privileges to manage the restaurant's menu by adding, modifying, and deleting products.
