A simple Astro project that introduces me and ships no JavaScript to the browser.\

Astro allows me to write these small project explanations in Markdown and render them as SSG, which is very convenient and provides great performance.\

A cool feature of Astro is the island architecture, which lets you hydrate only the components you need with JavaScript or any framework of your choice.\
