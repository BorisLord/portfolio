An issue was opened to add the ability to view the number of dependent packages for a given package.  
This was my first contribution, so I had to set up the project locally and start digging.  

I made significant skill progress while implementing this feature.  
- Built an SQL counter  
- Handled routing in Rust  
- Displayed the data using Fresh (Deno frontend framework based on Preact)  

Tech stack: Rust for the backend, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Fresh for the frontend.
