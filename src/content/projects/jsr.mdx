A feature was requested to show the number of dependent packages and package dependencies for a given package.

This was my first contribution to opensource. I had to set up the project locally and explore the codebase.

I learned a lot while working on this feature.

The main steps were:
- Writing two SQL queries using COUNT()
- Handling routing in Rust
- Displaying the data using Fresh
