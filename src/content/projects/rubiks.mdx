During the COVID period, I ordered a Rubik’s Cube and decided to spend some time solving it.\
Success! My best time is 1.12 minutes.

This inspired me to code a simple Rubik’s Cube simulation.\
You can’t solve it yet...\
I ran into a real challenge when trying to implement the cube’s rotations.

BabylonJS is a 3D library like Three.js, maintained by Microsoft.  
Somewhere in the back of my brain, I know I’ll come back to this project one day and make the cube fully solvable.
